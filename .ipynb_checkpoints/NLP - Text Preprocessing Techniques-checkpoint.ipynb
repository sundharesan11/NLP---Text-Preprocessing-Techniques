    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Stemming is the process of removing prefixes and suffixes from words to obtain their root or base form, known as the stem. Stemming algorithms apply heuristic rules to trim variations of words, which may not always result in valid words. This method is more aggressive than lemmatization and may produce stems that are not actual words.\n",

    "Lemmatization, on the other hand, involves analyzing the morphological structure of words to determine their lemma, which is the canonical or dictionary form of the word. Unlike stemming, lemmatization ensures that the resulting words are valid and exist in the language's dictionary. Lemmatization considers factors such as part of speech and context to accurately determine the lemma of a word."
